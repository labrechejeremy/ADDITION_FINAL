## ?? The Post-Quantum Revolution
Addition is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain engineered for the post-quantum era. While legacy networks remain vulnerable to future quantum computing threats, Addition employs **ML-DSA-87 (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm)** in strict mode to ensure absolute cryptographic longevity.

### ?? Competitive Analysis: Addition vs. The Market

| Feature | Addition (ADD) | Bitcoin (BTC) | Ethereum (ETH) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Signature Security** | **Quantum-Resistant (ML-DSA)** | ECDSA (Vulnerable) | ECDSA (Vulnerable) |
| **Max Supply** | **50,000,000 ADD** | 21,000,000 BTC | Infinite (Burn-based) |
| **Privacy Engine** | **Native Privacy Pools** | Transparent Only | Public (L2 Needed) |
| **P2P Hardening** | **Signed Handshakes** | Basic / Anonymous | Basic / Anonymous |
| **Architecture** | **Mining + Staking Hybrid** | Proof of Work | Proof of Stake |
| **Asset Support** | **Tokens & NFTs Native** | Limited (Ordinals) | Native (ERC-20/721) |

## ?? Core Technical Architecture

### ??? Hardened Security
- **ML-DSA-87 Strict Mode:** Future-proof signatures protecting against Shor's algorithm.
- **Signed P2P Transport:** Every node handshake is signed to prevent replay attacks and relay deduplication.
- **Rate-Limited Gossip:** Advanced transport hardening against DDoS and network congestion.

### ??? Privacy & Compliance
- **Privacy Pool Primitives:** Native shielding for assets and smart contract state.
- **Confidential Assets:** Issue tokens and NFTs with built-in privacy controls.

### ? Professional Frontend Suite
- **Wallet Pro:** Advanced Python-based dashboard for power users, miners, and stakers.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile:** Flutter-powered app for iOS, Android, and Windows.
- **Portal Bridge:** Real-time metrics and a sleek web entry point.
